This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers and vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits undefined behavior due to modifying a vector through a raw pointer after the vector's internal structure has changed. The solution is shown in `bugSolution.rs`, which avoids using raw pointers and instead uses safe Rust methods for vector manipulation.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management and the potential pitfalls of unsafe code in Rust.
